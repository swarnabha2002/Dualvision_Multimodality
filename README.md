## Overview

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance on visual reasoning with RGB imagery, yet remain fragile under common degradations such as fog, blur, and low-light conditions. Infrared (IR) imaging is a long-established complement to RGB and offers inherent robustness in these settings, but its integration into MLLMs is underexplored.

**DualVision** is a lightweight fusion module that efficiently incorporates IR–RGB information into MLLMs via patch-level **multi-scale localized cross-attention**. Each RGB patch token attends only to spatially corresponding IR regions, injecting complementary IR cues where they are most relevant — with low compute overhead and broad compatibility with existing MLLMs.

## Key Contributions

- **DualVision fusion module** — a lightweight IR–RGB fusion design built on multi-scale 2D local cross-attention, drop-in compatible with existing MLLMs.
- **DV-204K** — a dataset of ~25K aligned IR–RGB image pairs with ~204K modality-aware QA annotations for instruction tuning.
- **DV-500** — a curated benchmark of 500 IR–RGB image pairs with 500 QA pairs for evaluating cross-modal reasoning under degradations.
- **~75% compute savings** vs. naïve concatenation: RGB-IR concatenation costs O(4N²); DualVision fuses to N tokens at O(N²).
- **Strong empirical results** under blur, low-light, and fog — outperforming open- and closed-source MLLMs (LLaVA 1.5, Qwen2-VL, LLaVA-Next Interleave, LLaMA-4 Scout, Claude Sonnet 3.5v2, Claude Opus 4) across clean and degraded settings.

## Method

</p>

- **2D Local Cross-Attention** — each RGB token attends to IR tokens within a radius-r region centered at its location, enforcing spatially aligned fusion.
- **Multi-Scale Design** — multiple local cross-attention blocks applied sequentially with progressively larger radii, capturing multi-scale interactions while preserving locality.
- **Computational Efficiency** — fuses both modalities into N tokens (4× fewer than concatenation), reducing attention cost by ~75%.

## Datasets

This release provides **DV-204K** and **DV-500**, the datasets used in the paper.

We build our annotations on top of publicly available aligned IR–RGB image pairs. The
underlying **images** must be downloaded from their official sources:

- [LLVIP](https://bupt-ai-cz.github.io/LLVIP/)
- [HDRT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1566253525001824)

The **QA annotations** are released here under `data/v1/`:

| dataset | file | description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **DV-204K** | `data/v1/train.json` | 49,976 instruction-tuning conversations (~204K modality-aware QA pairs) over ~25K aligned IR–RGB pairs. |
| **DV-500**  | `data/v1/dv500.jsonl` | 500 yes/no questions over 500 IR–RGB pairs for evaluating cross-modal reasoning under degradations. |

Every training sample feeds the model **both modalities** (RGB + IR) regardless of which
one the question targets.

### 🚀 Coming soon: an upgraded dataset

> We are preparing a **larger, higher-quality annotation set**, verified with a stronger
> model (**Claude Opus 4.8**), with denser modality-aware QA. **Stay tuned — coming soon!**

### Arranging the images

Annotations reference images by relative path (`HDRT/...`, `LLVIP/...`). Download the two
image sets and arrange them under a single root:

```
<DATA_ROOT>/
├── HDRT/{visible,infrared}/      # visible = RGB, infrared = IR
└── LLVIP/{visible,infrared}/
```

Point the scripts at this directory via the `DATA_ROOT` environment variable.

## Setup

```bash
conda create -n dualvision python=3.10 -y
conda activate dualvision

cd core
# Install CUDA-matched torch first (example: CUDA 12.1)
pip install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .                       # installs the `llava` package
# Optional but recommended (after torch):
pip install flash-attn==2.5.8 --no-build-isolation
```

## Fusion strategies

The fusion module combines the per-modality CLIP features before the LLM:

| strategy      | description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `local_xattn` | **DualVision** — RGB queries attend to a local IR window (3 blocks, radii 1/2/3). |
| `concat`      | concatenate RGB + IR tokens (baseline). |

## Training

```bash
cd core
# Usage: bash scripts/train.sh <strategy>
#   strategy: local_xattn or concat   (default: local_xattn)
DATA_ROOT=/path/to/images bash scripts/train.sh local_xattn
```

- LoRA finetune of `liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-7b`, 8× GPU via DeepSpeed ZeRO-3, bf16, 2 epochs.
- **Robustness augmentation:** at load time each RGB image has a 25% (`--degradation_prob`)
  chance of a random degradation (blur / fog / low-light); the IR image is never degraded.
- Checkpoints, logs, and eval predictions are written under
  `runs/<strategy>_<version>/<timestamp>/`.
- `train.sh` automatically runs the evaluation below when training finishes.

**Image mode & resolution.** Runs in image mode (`--use_features False`): raw RGB and IR
jpgs are pushed through the frozen CLIP tower (`openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336`) at run
time, **336×336**, padded to square (no cropping), yielding 577 tokens per modality.

## Evaluation

`scripts/eval.sh` evaluates a trained checkpoint on **DV-500** across 13 conditions — the
clean original plus 12 RGB degradations (IR always clean):

```
blur{5,10,15,20}   bright{10,20,30,50}   fog{070,085,092,097}
```

```bash
cd core
DATA_ROOT=/path/to/images bash scripts/eval.sh <ckpt_path>
```

Each condition writes a predictions `*.jsonl` next to the answer file. Accuracy is exact
yes/no match (first yes/no token in the generation). Conditions run `NUM_GPUS` at a time.

> The checkpoint directory name must contain `llava` and `lora` (a requirement of the
> underlying LLaVA loader). `train.sh` handles this automatically.
